# tools
These are tools that do not require the sundile library, but are nice to have alongside it.

## itch-pack
This little bin will take your project, compile it to WASM, and package it into an [itch.io](itch.io)-friendly ZIP file.
Note: This requires [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/) to be installed.
